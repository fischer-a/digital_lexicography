## Notes for Francisco

### General thoughts: 
* I am the one who joined the course this week and asked about using her own data. For this week's assigment (assigment 2) I have not used my own data yet. But I will try to work with it from next week on. Thanks for letting me join the course. 
* missed the first 2 weeks of class, I hope I got everything right about how to do the assignments in general. 
* have not worked with Github before. In case something is not working out in terms of access etc., please let me know.

### Assigment 2: 
* There are comments in parse_beolingus.py.
* I tried to solve task 2 as code, just trying things out. 

### Assignment 1: 
* I missed this one because I only joined the course this week. Thanks for sharing the code with all of us. 

## Notes for myself
#### Assigment2 : 

> 1. In our newly created module 'input_output.py', add a method for writing a set into a text file.

> 2. We saw that we can not properly sort a set/list containing German words with the standard sorted() function. How can we solve this?

> 3. Read the TEI Chapter for Dictionaries: http://www.tei-c.org/release/doc/tei-p5-doc/en/html/DI.htm
