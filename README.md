### General thoughts: 
I am the one who joined the course this week and asked about using her own data. For this week's assigment (assigment 2) I have not used my own data yet. But I will try to work with my own data from next week on. 

Thanks for letting me join the course. 

### Assigment 2: 
Since I missed the two weeks of class, I am now sure if we are to comment our code or write something somewhere else. 
I just commented in 'parse-beolingus' this time. 

### Assignment 1: 
I missed this one since I only joined the course this week. Thanks for sharing the code with all of us. 

### Notes for myself
#### Assigment2 : 
1. In our newly created module 'input_output.py', add a method for writing a set into a text file.

2. We saw that we can not properly sort a set/list containing German words with the standard sorted() function. How can we solve this?

3. Read the TEI Chapter for Dictionaries: http://www.tei-c.org/release/doc/tei-p5-doc/en/html/DI.htm
